## About This Project

This repository contains two simple Python programs:

1. **Even or Odd Checker**:
   - A program that loops through numbers from 1 to 15 and checks whether each number is even or odd. It uses a `for` loop and an `if` statement for the checks, printing the result for each number.

2. **Basic Calculator**:
   - A calculator program that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).
   - The program accepts two numeric inputs from the user and prompts them to select an operation. It uses error handling to manage invalid inputs and prevent division by zero.

These projects showcase fundamental programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, user input, and error handling in Python.
